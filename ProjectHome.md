Renders an isometric view of a dat or NBT (.mclevel) format Minecraft level to a transparent png.

This project uses so much stuff from so many different places that giving it a proper license would be near impossible.
I am distributing this software in hope that people will find it useful, and I do not intend to infringe on anyone's copyright.
